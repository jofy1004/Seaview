I am considering to drop the idea of visiting Cambridge this summer.
Here are some reasons why?

   1. As you have explained me, summer is not as very good time to visit.
   2. I still didn't get a invitation letter and my Academics are gripping
   leaving me a little or no time/money for flight tickets and VISA.
   3. I have to bear my travel expenses.
   4. You won't be available in the summer.

The only pushing reason, why I want to visit is because of cambridge. I
want to strode in the very place where many of my role-models moved and
worked.
I guess my desire to visit Cambridge can wait.

However I always love to work, whether I am in India or in Cambridge. So,
if you find some interesting paper that you want me to work on; please let
me know.

Thank you.

rate is reversed in the case of ratio(p). This is exactly reversed

The cross correlation between number of sp cases and total number of
cases is close to 0.95.(check out the image)
So we may draw the conclusion that
contrary to what we think intuitively The number of cases seems to
depend inversely on the number of sp cases. This may prove that the
biggest culprit in spreading the disease is not human but something
else.
There is something else that is making the disease sustainable even
after centuries.
India is endemic to malaria not because of its high population or lack
of awareness, but something else(Need to figure this out!!!!)
Great!

I am Vihari Piratla a CSE 3rd year UG at IIT Mandi, India.
I am interested in NIHR Research methods Summer
Internship<http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGF389/nihr-research-methods-summer-internship/>
and
also I am planning to visit University of cambridge underPietro
Lio<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/> for
exercising possibility of further collaborated research, So I am
considering the possibility of also doing an intern during my stay. Here at
IIT Mandi we are given only a month of summer vacation and 3 months of
winter vacation, Now given that this internship lasts for 3 summer months;
Is there any possibility of doing the intern for 2 months in summer and one
month in winter? [I can request my institute to provide me a leave for a
month.]
Thank you.

Hi Vihari

You are selected and sorry for the confusion. Maybe you filled the
application form twice so one app got accepted and the other was rejected.
Welcome to the GSA community. You can join the email group. I am wondering
if you can make it to the GSA summit since getting to Goa is difficult from
Mandi.

Thanks
Ashwani

to continue the AUAV project.

Project AUAV [Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]: is a students initiated
project. The objective of the project is to put in intelligence into an
aerial vehicle, that makes it move autonomously (Without any human
intervention.). This is a funded project and utilized funds equivalent to 3
lac rupees. The project was started with a sole aim of participation in
IARC (http://iarc.angel-strike.com/). The degree of autonomous behavior is
dependent on the 6th mission problem statement of IARC.

There were many unforeseen problems and challenges, that we couldn't
participate in the contest last year. We are now looking for students who
can take on the project and also represent the team in IARC either in china
or in USA (depending on the VISA availability).

Discussion seminar will be held on Tuesday at 3:00 PM in Mandi and
on Wednesday in 5:00 PM in Kamand.
The seminar will last for an hour or may be longer.
The Key things that will be discussed in the seminar are

   1. IARC and 6th mission problem statement.
   2. The aerial platform and other equipment used and procured.
   3. What's done so far.
   4. Challenges faced.
   5. What else to be done.
   6. Timeline of the project.

The technicality of the content may differ for 2nd and 1st year.
Looking forward to meet you all in the seminar.

Please feel free to call me on the number given below in case of any query.

Thank you

I am Vihari Piratla, a student of IIT Mandi enrolled in CS 669 course.
We actually thought of doing "Cervical Cancer detection through pap images"
under Anil Sao sir and unfortunately we were unable to procure data for
this project and have to choose an another one.
Now, about the project to be chosen, I have many of these
ideas squatting in my mind... please help me choose one based on the
particular projects complexity, applicability and relevance.

1) Gesture recognition with a single camera(without any 3d model of the
scenario). This has a lot of applicability and is an emerging technology.
If I am able to somehow classify human hand in the image from the
background, then sequence of movements of the shape can be used to detect
the gesture. Challenge is how efficient and real-time we can make this.
Refer this for one such application: https://flutterapp.com/
2) Image search or song or voice search with image,voice respectively in
one's own database(i.e. in their own computing device's storage).
3) Quick Image labeling/tagging depending upon the scene. This may have lot
of applicability in  some applications like Project Glass of Google.

To just brief about me: I have been working as an amateur on image
processing and Computer Vision right from my first year. Here are some of
the projects that I have made.

Visual Odometry - To estimate the 6D transformation between two pairs of
stereo images. Required as a sub-problem for Autonomous Vehicle project.

Projects related to HCI.

1) A HCI project that I made in my 4th semester.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9z3Jae0EyU
This was a kind of product, developed on windows OS with the help of OpenCV
library. The software/product allows one to interact with the computing
device right from the surface on to which it is projected onto
(irrespective of the surface) through the webcam attached to the computing
device.

2) Gesture Recognition; Something similar to this one
https://flutterapp.com/. Well! if you don't have time to go through that
one, it is a real time symbol/gesture recognition through any image sensor
like a webcam. Basically the ultimate goal is the interaction with the
computing device in real time. This is n't new but we tried it in our own
way. Report on work done is attached with the name PR_*.pdf.

I am also interested in Robotics, Computer Vision, Statistics.

Project that is not related to HCI but may be of some interest.
3) Visual Odometry - To estimate the 6D transformation between two pairs of
stereo images. We did it as a sub-problem for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle[AUAV] project. We managed to do it with stereo rig and also with
Microsoft Kinect.

I feel the references that you have cited in the Seaview draft are not

I read(reread) almost all of them, I understand the common reasons why log
files are consulted and challenges in analysing them.
My question is what am I reading them for?
Is it for critical comparison between the two?
or to impart a framework or organization into the paper?
Thank you.

for the sake of seaview we can classify log file analysis broadly as:
1. Where source code is relevant and

Relevant I mean helpful.
Its not relevant or helpful in the case of intrusion detection(like DOS
attack) or system monitoring(operation profiling) here the dimensional
grouping of variables is of very less use.
It is relevant in the cases of ensuring correctness or exception caused
because of the bug in the code or misconfigurations or
because of the bad input values which were not handled well with asserts
for that matter.

As M.Nagappan puts it: It make more sense in the case of TCP flow to adopt
a log abstraction which can talk about flow rather than individual
fragments.
Though this can be done even in log analysis phase, the scope limited.
As to make Seaview useful in the case 2[see above enumeration], needs a lot
of robustness in log abstraction or log analysis phase to adopt many
contexts of log files,
we shall conclude that Seaview has more relevance in case 1.

Tudumi and Mielog fall into case 2 and are useful in visualization of timed
events and outlier detection.
Mielog:
The severity of logs are based on the frequency of occurrence and
differentiated based on their lengths.
The length of the logs are what then serve to detect outliers.

I can see normal behavior in tomcat as that of jlnp but I
have absolutely no idea if SEAVIEW is receiving the log messages and where
is going to be the location of run.logs.js, info.js.
I tried to figure it out myself but I couldn't, Some documentation on

Seaview adds a deeper semantic understanding to the log files by program
analysis with a tool called Unifi.

We will demonstrate the capabilities of such an addition and leave the rest
to the imagination of the user.

We will be focussing on

   1. Clustering and outlier detection.
   2. Root cause analysis with outlier detection and dimensional relation
   to other variables.
   3. Enhanced capability for visualisation because of the knowledge of
   dimensions across various log lines.
   4. Mielog extension as is appropriate to Seaview for temporal patterns
   and spatial patterns for that matter. Outlier detection.

Seaview adds a deeper semantic understanding to the log files by program
analysis with a tool called Unifi.

We will demonstrate the capabilities of such an addition and leave the rest
to the imagination of the user.

We will be focussing on

   1. Clustering and outlier detection.
   2. Root cause analysis with outlier detection and dimensional relation
   to other variables.
   3. Enhanced capability for visualisation because of the knowledge of
   dimensions across various log lines.
   4. Mielog extension as is appropriate to Seaview for temporal patterns
   and spatial patterns for that matter. Outlier detection.

Because of this some compatibility issues are arising. I am getting "Unable

One incompatibility I have noticed is it is  loading ips file instead of

I need source code because there is some code I need to add to make it work.

I have made changes such that the software is scale-able with the log file

The complexity overhead is supposed to be constant theoretically, although
a slight limping with page switching  is observed with larger log files. [I

I am using this right one, this works very well and solution for everything
from filtering to display of large text in browser.
This is what is used in Version 3.0 of Seaview. I did not find any
performance concerns with this except that the SlickGrid doesn't allow for
Variable column height(the author is very stubborn not to implement this),
I sat down and tried in include this at the expense of breaking the page
after some number of entries, so that the complexity doesn't scale up with
n(number of entries).[This is what I explained you on phone and thought of

I have a bizarre situation, I thought your suggestion can help.

   - I have to do an internship.


   1. I can either do a small internship and try to focus on Seaview. (Yes!
   this can be possible, I can atleast give it a try; even though the company
   that I may go is stressing on working hours from 10 A.M to 6:00 P.M).
   2. I can do intern in a good company, if I get to and get a good
   recommendation.


   - As a side note I also have to give GRE.

What do you think is the best thing to do at the moment?
Considering that my primary goal is to secure a seat in good University.

About the GE research: Software-science analytic's group of GE looks good
to me and interesting and Work wise I look forward to work in it.

Thank you.

[8] of Seaview.
What is the scope of Seaview in analyzing event logs, given that it is very
tedious to instrument whole of the kernel code.
In the draft you wrote that the SLCT "... to detect when anomalous sets of
values are logged together". I feel this statement is misleading, all it
does is to cluster the lines in the log file and presents one with
outliers, which doesn't seem to fit in to any of the clusters clustered.
For anomaly detection, one needs system profile to be defined, is n't it?

It may aid the programmer to debug, if we can also show the outliers
and anomaly detection from temporal patterns!
Please let me know your thoughts on this to me.

Thank you.

be detected by Seaview.
I have gone through bugs-database and mail archives of tomcat, glassfish
and JBoss.
Though log messages are very important resource for debugging not many
bug-reports include useful bug-reports.
Bugs/errors like null pointer exceptions or
index out of bounds or
those caused by configuration errors like no disk space available are all
evident even without extensive analysis of log files.
I realized that Seaview is good at bugs where
a) root cause is not known (like in Sudden crashes, slow startup or in case
of less performance)
b) cause is known but remedy or actual cause is buried deep inside. (like
not releasing threads, not closing database connections).
Am I right?
and also I tried a lot(in the case of tomcat) finding these kind of
bugs/issues, as I said log files are not/mildly playing any important role.
I am kind of stuck now, please help me by giving some pointers;
like what bugs/issues to look for,
where to look for.
Thank you.

Hi Vihari

You are selected and sorry for the confusion. Maybe you filled the
application form twice so one app got accepted and the other was rejected.
Welcome to the GSA community. You can join the email group. I am wondering
if you can make it to the GSA summit since getting to Goa is difficult from
Mandi.

Thanks
Ashwani

I am very passionate about doing research in fields like

2) Computer on wheels or Autonomous vehicles like drones and Self driving cars.
3) Methods on revolutionizing interaction between human and computer.
4) Understanding human cognition.
So, after 3-5 years I see myself as a research scholar working in one
or all of the fields listed above.
After 10 years I see myself as a researcher working in Software giants
like Microsoft, Google and making my research and voice being heard
out loud.

for the sake of seaview we can classify log file analysis broadly as:
1. Where source code is relevant and
2. and where it is not.
Relevant I mean helpful.
Its not relevant or helpful in the case of intrusion detection(like DOS
attack) or system monitoring(operation profiling) here the dimensional
grouping of variables is of very less use.
It is relevant in the cases of ensuring correctness or exception caused
because of the bug in the code or misconfigurations or
because of the bad input values which were not handled well with asserts
for that matter.

As M.Nagappan puts it: It make more sense in the case of TCP flow to adopt
a log abstraction which can talk about flow rather than individual
fragments.
Though this can be done even in log analysis phase, the scope limited.
As to make Seaview useful in the case 2[see above enumeration], needs a lot
of robustness in log abstraction or log analysis phase to adopt many
contexts of log files,
we shall conclude that Seaview has more relevance in case 1.

Tudumi and Mielog fall into case 2 and are useful in visualization of timed
events and outlier detection.
Mielog:
The severity of logs are based on the frequency of occurrence and
differentiated based on their lengths.
The length of the logs are what then serve to detect outliers.

to continue the AUAV project.

Project AUAV [Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]: is a students initiated
project. The objective of the project is to put in intelligence into an
aerial vehicle, that makes it move autonomously (Without any human
intervention.). This is a funded project and utilized funds equivalent to 3
lac rupees. The project was started with a sole aim of participation in
IARC (http://iarc.angel-strike.com/). The degree of autonomous behavior is
dependent on the 6th mission problem statement of IARC.

There were many unforeseen problems and challenges, that we couldn't
participate in the contest last year. We are now looking for students who
can take on the project and also represent the team in IARC either in china
or in USA (depending on the VISA availability).

We are planning to host a discussion seminar individually both at kamand
and at Mandi to demonstrate the project in more detail, to explain what we
have done so far and to discuss the timeline and challenges.
Please fill the form below to give us the info about your available
timings. (please mark every date you are available)

to continue the AUAV project.

Project AUAV [Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]: is a students initiated
project. The objective of the project is to put in intelligence into an
aerial vehicle, that makes it move autonomously (Without any human
intervention.). This is a funded project and utilized funds equivalent to 3
lac rupees. The project was started with a sole aim of participation in
IARC (http://iarc.angel-strike.com/). The degree of autonomous behavior is
dependent on the 6th mission problem statement of IARC.

There were many unforeseen problems and challenges, that we couldn't
participate in the contest last year. We are now looking for students who
can take on the project and also represent the team in IARC either in china
or in USA (depending on the VISA availability).

Discussion seminar will be held on Tuesday at 3:00 PM in Mandi and
on Wednesday in 5:00 PM in Kamand.
The seminar will last for an hour or may be longer.
The Key things that will be discussed in the seminar are

   1. IARC and 6th mission problem statement.
   2. The aerial platform and other equipment used and procured.
   3. What's done so far.
   4. Challenges faced.
   5. What else to be done.
   6. Timeline of the project.

The technicality of the content may differ for 2nd and 1st year.
Looking forward to meet you all in the seminar.

Please feel free to call me on the number given below in case of any query.

Thank you

Here are some reasons why?

   1. As you have explained me, summer is not as very good time to visit.
   2. I still didn't get a invitation letter and my Academics are gripping
   leaving me a little or no time/money for flight tickets and VISA.
   3. I have to bear my travel expenses.
   4. You won't be available in the summer.

The only pushing reason, why I want to visit is because of cambridge. I
want to strode in the very place where many of my role-models moved and
worked.
I guess my desire to visit Cambridge can wait.

However I always love to work, whether I am in India or in Cambridge. So,
if you find some interesting paper that you want me to work on; please let

I have gone through the paper, it is quite an interesting application.
This paper spans many areas, many of which I am ignorant of. So I cannot
claim to understand the whole paper but I got the gist.
There is a lot of work done in this paper.
What is the future application or extension you have thought of this work?

I will be happy to work on papers like this and also on topics like bio
inspired networking and sensing.
I came to know that I can do my industrial internship even in December
2013, so I will be more than happy to join you in Cambridge this summer.
Better, if we can chat sometime.
Thank you.

It's an interesting project and we are looking forward to take this as a
project for ISTP and research this out.
The reasons why we want to take this is
1) It serves our appetite for technology well.
2) Impact is at large.
3) We have to roam a bit as a part of research.
Though it is very challenging, there are ways in which this can be done; we
have a few ideas.
Please let us know what you think.
Thank you.

IARC (http://iarc.angel-strike.com/). The degree of autonomous behavior is

There were many unforeseen problems and challenges, that we couldn't
participate in the contest last year. We are now looking for students who
can take on the project and also represent the team in IARC either in china

We are planning to host a discussion seminar individually both at kamand

have done so far and to discuss the timeline and challenges.

participate in the contest last year. We are now looking for students who
can take on the project and also represent the team in IARC either in china
or in USA (depending on the VISA availability).

Discussion seminar will be held on Tuesday at 3:00 PM in Mandi and
on Wednesday in 5:00 PM in Kamand.
The seminar will last for an hour or may be longer.
The Key things that will be discussed in the seminar are

   1. IARC and 6th mission problem statement.
   2. The aerial platform and other equipment used and procured.
   3. What's done so far.
   4. Challenges faced.
   5. What else to be done.
   6. Timeline of the project.

The technicality of the content may differ for 2nd and 1st year.
Looking forward to meet you all in the seminar.

Please feel free to call me on the number given below in case of any query.

Thank you

Now, I have these questions:
1) Why is it that when I inject some sleep in the other processes(I mean
other than root) of the ring; NO receive is taking place?
2) Even when the buffer size is only one, how is it that root node is able
to dispatch messages through MPI_Bsend without an error? for example the
case when it needs to send total 10 messages at a rate of 1000 per second
and with buffer size of 1. MPI_Bsend is able to dispatch all the messages
without any error of "buffer full"; irrespective of the presence of sleep()
in other processes of the ring!

In short How on earth is MPI_Bsend is not giving me an error "Insufficient
space in buffer" even if my buffersize is size enough to accommodate only a
single message, MPI_Bsend did not show an error ...] doc=null  Clue$ClueStats: serialVersionUID=1 version=1 answerPartOfAnyAddressBookName=false nMessagesWithAnswer=-1 nThreadsWithAnswer=-1 daysSinceFirstMention=-1 daysSinceLastMention=-1 histogramOfAnswerOccurrence=null answerCategory=[none] namesInClue=0 nSmileys=0 clueLength=49 sentenceNumInMessage=-1 nValidClueCandidates=-1 answerNERCategoryInClue=[none] daysOld=127 dateOfMessage=-1 namesInMessage=-1 charsInMessage=-1 answerPartOfRecipientName=false nRecipients=-1 subjectLength=-1 nMessagesInThread=-1 daysSpannedByThread=-1 threadInitiatedByUser=false finalScore=-36.850002 sentenceNumBoost=0.0 docScore=0.0 linesBoost=0.0 namesScore=0.0 exclamationScore=0.0 smileyScore=0.0 lengthBoost=-38.75 ::: lines boost = :::SV267:::1.0:::

I am Vihari Piratla, a student of IIT Mandi enrolled in CS 669 course.
We actually thought of doing "Cervical Cancer detection through pap images"
under Anil Sao sir and unfortunately we were unable to procure data for
this project and have to choose an another one.
Now, about the project to be chosen, I have many of these
ideas squatting in my mind... please help me choose one based on the
particular projects complexity, applicability and relevance.

1) Gesture recognition with a single camera(without any 3d model of the
scenario). This has a lot of applicability and is an emerging technology.
If I am able to somehow classify human hand in the image from the
background, then sequence of movements of the shape can be used to detect
the gesture. Challenge is how efficient and real-time we can make this.
Refer this for one such application: https://flutterapp.com/
2) Image search or song or voice search with image,voice respectively in
one's own database(i.e. in their own computing device's storage).
3) Quick Image labeling/tagging depending upon the scene. This may have lot
of applicability in  some applications like Project Glass of Google.

To just brief about me: I have been working as an amateur on image
processing and Computer Vision right from my first year. Here are some of
the projects that I have made.

Visual Odometry - To estimate the 6D transformation between two pairs of
stereo images. Required as a sub-problem for Autonomous Vehicle project.

screen(akin), with the aid of just a webcam.

Hi Vihari

You are selected and sorry for the confusion. Maybe you filled the
application form twice so one app got accepted and the other was rejected.
Welcome to the GSA community. You can join the email group. I am wondering
if you can make it to the GSA summit since getting to Goa is difficult from
Mandi.

Thanks

Can you please send me the reference book on radial distribution function,
I couldn't find it.

When equilibrating temperature, the Boltzmann constant is of order 10^-23
in SI units; how much do you want me to take it? I can take some constant
but then it may not be coherent with your notion of temperature.

Somehow, my g function is not having a continuous stoke but like many delta
functions, irrespective of temperature and density. Shouldn't the lattice
points be uniform and equally spaced in the case of  liquids and gases?
Thank you.

I have a bizarre situation, I thought your suggestion can help.

   - I have to do an internship.


   1. I can either do a small internship and try to focus on Seaview. (Yes!
   this can be possible, I can atleast give it a try; even though the company
   that I may go is stressing on working hours from 10 A.M to 6:00 P.M).
   2. I can do intern in a good company, if I get to and get a good
   recommendation.


   - As a side note I also have to give GRE.

What do you think is the best thing to do at the moment?
Considering that my primary goal is to secure a seat in good University.

About the GE research: Software-science analytic's group of GE looks good
to me and interesting and Work wise I look forward to work in it.

Thank you.

for the sake of seaview we can classify log file analysis broadly as:
1. Where source code is relevant and
2. and where it is not.
Relevant I mean helpful.
Its not relevant or helpful in the case of intrusion detection(like DOS
attack) or system monitoring(operation profiling) here the dimensional
grouping of variables is of very less use.
It is relevant in the cases of ensuring correctness or exception caused
because of the bug in the code or misconfigurations or
because of the bad input values which were not handled well with asserts
for that matter.

As M.Nagappan puts it: It make more sense in the case of TCP flow to adopt
a log abstraction which can talk about flow rather than individual
fragments.
Though this can be done even in log analysis phase, the scope limited.
As to make Seaview useful in the case 2[see above enumeration], needs a lot
of robustness in log abstraction or log analysis phase to adopt many
contexts of log files,
we shall conclude that Seaview has more relevance in case 1.

Tudumi and Mielog fall into case 2 and are useful in visualization of timed
events and outlier detection.
Mielog:
The severity of logs are based on the frequency of occurrence and
differentiated based on their lengths.
The length of the logs are what then serve to detect outliers.

So that we won't have this hassle from next time for travel expenses.
That said, do you have any plans for my travel expenses?

to continue the AUAV project.

Project AUAV [Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]: is a students initiated
project. The objective of the project is to put in intelligence into an
aerial vehicle, that makes it move autonomously (Without any human
intervention.). This is a funded project and utilized funds equivalent to 3
lac rupees. The project was started with a sole aim of participation in
IARC (http://iarc.angel-strike.com/). The degree of autonomous behavior is
dependent on the 6th mission problem statement of IARC.

There were many unforeseen problems and challenges, that we couldn't
participate in the contest last year. We are now looking for students who
can take on the project and also represent the team in IARC either in china
or in USA (depending on the VISA availability).

Discussion seminar will be held on Tuesday at 3:00 PM in Mandi and
on Wednesday in 5:00 PM in Kamand.
The seminar will last for an hour or may be longer.
The Key things that will be discussed in the seminar are

   1. IARC and 6th mission problem statement.
   2. The aerial platform and other equipment used and procured.
   3. What's done so far.
   4. Challenges faced.
   5. What else to be done.
   6. Timeline of the project.

The technicality of the content may differ for 2nd and 1st year.
Looking forward to meet you all in the seminar.

Please feel free to call me on the number given below in case of any query.

Thank you

Why are you using ROS?] url=[browse?docId=[Gmail]/Sent Mail-1427&nofilter=] fullMessage=[Some of the things are still unclear to me about your project like:

   1. Why are you using ROS?
   2. How many computing modules are you using?
   3. Is there multiprocessing or multi-threading that you are trying to
   implement?
   4. Are you trying to use both the cores or exploit some amount of
   parallelism in computational module by point 3?

Anyway here is the solution:
There is nothing like invocation and killing specifically in ROS.
The hierarchy of executables is Nodes and nodelets, Similarly the hierarchy
of communication between nodes is topics and Services.

*Topics:* this is a more general framework for communication between
various nodes on the same host or on different irrespective of number of
nodes that are publishing on a particular topic(then URI of the node can be
used to distinguish various nodal topics) or how many nodes subscribed to a
given topic. These nodes communicate with the help of Master node (I am
talking about the ROS Mater node here i.e. roscore that you start at first).
*Services: *These are special variants of Topics, in which only one node
will be receiving the requests and functions as a server. This is more of a
request response thing.

What I suggest you do,

   1. Launch all the nodes that you are going to use in the
   whole lifetime of the s/w with roslaunch and appropriately subscribing to
   topics required.
   2. Write service routines in all the nodes. As shown
here<http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28c%2B%2B%29>
and
   also advertise all the services that you are offering (ofcourse!).
   3. Let us say you have faceDetection(FD) and ObjectRecognition(OR)
   DepthComputation(DC) as all the nodes you have. Now, the services on these
   nodes can be something like getFacePosition, recogniseObject and
   getDepthMap respectively. See
this<http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams>
   .
   4. When these requests were made; each of the nodes can just call the
   functions that work on the images, that were acquired from the topic
   subscribed by that node and returns the desired result as a response back.
   5. There is also another way, that is to just push the result messages
   on to the  out topic and you access that info by just subscribing that
   topic. (No shitty service-request setup). The disadvantage is that,
   irrespective of whether you are using/subscribed on to the topic, it always
   does the computation.
   6. With Services, such unnecessary computations are avoided and I don't
   see any specific use of initiating and killing, as you can just put the
   request whenever you want. The only reason I can see is it puts the USB/PCI
   bus of the cam busy. If you dont want this to happen, then just define
   another service that is kill. See
here<http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams#rosservice_list>for
such an example of kill and then call ros::shutdown() as a response to
   this service.

1) As a sub-problem of AUAV (Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.) our task
is to perform the following operations in real time frequency(10-15
times/second)

   - To handle large data from a 3D sensor via usb.
   - To also read values from various other sensors like IMU, sonars e.t.c.
   - To convert and compress the data from 3D sensor to decrease the
   throughput for transmission.

We managed to do all this with the help of ROS(a distributed computing
platform).
Motivation:
Though we managed to do it somehow, we did not achieve any optimality in
deploying various nodes on various machines. Let me explain this a bit more
elaborate, we have an atom dual core 1.8 GHz processor on the kopter, This
has to be responsive and at the same time should do some minimum
computation. This requirement of it is causing some delay in reading some
value of sensors. If we could transfer some of the operations that the
onboard computer is doing to some other nodes on the distributed network.
then the system can be more responsive. I hope this course will help me
achieve this goal. If we were knowledgeable about how concurrency works we
will end up decreasing the latency and increasing the battery life of
battery(by decreasing throughput.) that on the kopter.

There is a subtle difference between factorization and decomposition; In
decomposition you try to split the matrix to 3 or more matrices and in
factorization you just split it into two matrices, which is what makes
factorization more suitable to dyadic data i.e. applications involving
documents and terms (keyword search), users and items(recommendation
systems) e.t.c. See
this<https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Franger.uta.edu%2F~ch=

for more lucid picture of factorization.
There are many ways of doing Matrix factorization PCA/SVD , non negative
matrix factorization, LU decomposition, cholsky decomposition to name a few
and the situation is further complicated with each method having various
algorithms like kernal PCA, 2dSVD e.t.c. Now mam was talking about the
challenge of not recomputing from scratch in the case of online algorithms
upon addition of new data.
It is better to focus on NMF given the vast applications of
NMF<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization#Algorith=

.
There are many papers on distributed implementations of NMF[1][2].
For the implementations of Online NMF[3].
Distributed NMF in itself is not very complicated, it will be a novel
approach if we do concurrent programming with online NMF.
So here's the approach:

   1. Its a mixed approach of both [1] and [3].
   2. The n*d matrix has to be split in to multiple programs in a fashion
   shown in the figure 1(a) of [1]. The author doesn't support that way but
   here we dont have any other go I guess. (Just think about it, if you don=
t
   get it I will tell you.)

Well! this is rather long mail, so start by reading thoroughly [3] and let
me know if you have any questions, then read [1].

Its better to start with something and optimize: you can find lot of
repositories on github
<https://github.com/search?p=3D1&q=3Dnon+negative+factorization&ref=3Dsearc=
hresults&type=3DRepositories>
There is one repo for CUDA.

Analysis on MapReduce" http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/119077/dnmf.pdf.
Though the implementation is in the view of Map Reduce, author claims that
this can be generalized to MPI based systems. Its just that they have
Mapreduce cliuster right where the data resides. He talks of Probabilistic
NMF and talks of Gaussian, poisson and Exponential distributions. I don't
see this as much different from one of our lab assignment's of data
distribution of matrix; but rather will be dealing with larger matrices.

for more lucid picture of factorization.
There are many ways of doing Matrix factorization PCA/SVD , non negative
matrix factorization, LU decomposition, cholsky decomposition to name a few
and the situation is further complicated with each method having various
algorithms like kernal PCA, 2dSVD e.t.c. Now mam was talking about the
challenge of not recomputing from scratch in the case of online algorithms
upon addition of new data.
It is better to focus on NMF given the vast applications of
NMF<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization#Algorith=
ms>
.
There are many papers on distributed implementations of NMF[1][2].
For the implementations of Online NMF[3].
Distributed NMF in itself is not very complicated, it will be a novel
approach if we do concurrent programming with online NMF.
So here's the approach:

   1. Its a mixed approach of both [1] and [3].
   2. The n*d matrix has to be split in to multiple programs in a fashion
   shown in the figure 1(a) of [1]. The author doesn't support that way but
   here we dont have any other go I guess. (Just think about it, if you don=
t
   get it I will tell you.)

Well! this is rather long mail, so start by reading thoroughly [3] and let
me know if you have any questions, then read [1].

Its better to start with something and optimize: you can find lot of
repositories on github
<https://github.com/search?p=3D1&q=3Dnon+negative+factorization&ref=3Dsearc=
hresults&type=3DRepositories>
There is one repo for CUDA.

[1] "Distributed Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Web-Scale Dyadic Data
Analysis on MapReduce" http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/119077/dnmf.pdf.
Though the implementation is in the view of Map Reduce, author claims that
this can be generalized to MPI based systems. Its just that they have
Mapreduce cliuster right where the data resides. He talks of Probabilistic
NMF and talks of Gaussian, poisson and Exponential distributions. I don't
see this as much different from one of our lab assignment's of data
distribution of matrix; but rather will be dealing with larger matrices.

More-ever the idea is not online.

Same as [1] except that they used Stochastic Gradient Descent method.

Project AUAV [Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]: is a students initiated

aerial vehicle, that makes it move autonomously (Without any human
intervention.). This is a funded project and utilized funds equivalent to 3
lac rupees. The project was started with a sole aim of participation in
IARC (http://iarc.angel-strike.com/). The degree of autonomous behavior is
dependent on the 6th mission problem statement of IARC.

There were many unforeseen problems and challenges, that we couldn't
participate in the contest last year. We are now looking for students who
can take on the project and also represent the team in IARC either in china
or in USA (depending on the VISA availability).

We are planning to host a discussion seminar individually both at kamand

have done so far and to discuss the timeline and challenges.

I am writing this mail after seeing the update in your following site
http://xenon.stanford.edu/~hangal/
You haven't specified any locality constraint for the student, so I just
want to give it a try.
I am very interested in the field of HCI.
Well! I am Vihari Piratla, a 3rd year CSE U.G at IIT Mandi.
I have attached my resume(with the name Vihari*.pdf) with this mail.
Here are some of the courses that I have taken that may be of interest
1) Pattern Recognition.
2) Artificial Intelligence
3) Statistical time series analysis.

Here are some projects that that may be of Interest.
Projects related to HCI.

1) A HCI project that I made in my 4th semester.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9z3Jae0EyU
This was a kind of product, developed on windows OS with the help of OpenCV
library. The software/product allows one to interact with the computing
device right from the surface on to which it is projected onto
(irrespective of the surface) through the webcam attached to the computing
device.

2) Gesture Recognition; Something similar to this one
https://flutterapp.com/. Well! if you don't have time to go through that
one, it is a real time symbol/gesture recognition through any image sensor
like a webcam. Basically the ultimate goal is the interaction with the
computing device in real time. This is n't new but we tried it in our own
way. Report on work done is attached with the name PR_*.pdf.

I am also interested in Robotics, Computer Vision, Statistics.

Project that is not related to HCI but may be of some interest.
3) Visual Odometry - To estimate the 6D transformation between two pairs of
stereo images. We did it as a sub-problem for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle[AUAV] project. We managed to do it with stereo rig and also with
Microsoft Kinect.

Configuring firewall was a project undertaken as a part of Networking
course by me along with other two.
We wrote some simple rules, some of which are redundant as many of the
routers have that particular set of rule implemented, but for an academic
project that's OK I guess! We used iptables to drop or forward packets. We
targeted some specific kind of DoS(Denial of Service) attacks like Smurf
Attack, ping flood, SYN flood (Attacks by exploiting the vulnerability in
the 3 way hand shake of TCP protocol), Low- Rate TCP targeted DoS,  by some
simple rules targeted to mitigate specific attacks like client validation,
Stateful firewalls, limiting bandwidth usage per request, blacklisting
suspicious clients and delaying the request of blacklisted addresses.
I have included the bash script used and the project report(I am skeptical
on how well this report can boost understanding).

btw: I am also going through the course of Concurrent programming by the
same instructor; I haven't included this in the resume so I just want to
mention it.

Thank you.

Great! Yes, I would like to work with you.
But, I have a strange case:
Actually I need a certificate of internship and at the same time has to
give my GRE exams in the vacation.
My internship certificate is valid only if I really attend the company and
"get some exposure".
So, is it possible for you to provide me the internship certificate: saying
specifically that I was with you rather than at home during the time of
vacation (or)
at-least not specifically saying that the internship is work from home?

I would love to write such articles, irrespective of the money you give me.

In the intern description, you mentioned a time period of 2 months. I
cannot work for 3 months as I have vacation for only 2 months. I can try
but I may not deliver my best efforts.

Talking about the start date of internship I have my vacation starting from
June 18th (yes! you heard it right I am in IIT Mandi(HP) hence a
strange curriculum). I will tell you the exact date of when I can start to
work in few days.

Thank you.
Hope to hear you back.

I did perform any of the steps that I am supposed if I got to use log4j,
but it still create muse(name of my web-app).log in /tmp directory with a
message like this in catalina.out.

/tmp/tomcat7-tomcat7-tmp/muse.log
True that I am using log4j not juli in the webapp. This is how I am getting
the handle in the class files.
public static Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Crossword.class);

This is the log4j.properties file in the WEBINF/classes folder of the
webapp.
I tried few things like appending the line log4j.logger=debug with no avail.
# For the general syntax of property based configuration files see the

Can you tell me if you are able to run and generate the log files in FINE
Level debugging, Sorry I did not mention this earlier.
I am still getting error with enum type with FINE Level debug ON.
Also the other two calls that got generated in INFO level debugging
vanished this time!
i.e.
 public static java.lang.StringBuilder log(java.lang.StringBuilder,
edu.stanford.muse.email.AddressBookStats, int);
and
 public static java.lang.StringBuilder log(java.lang.StringBuilder,
edu.stanford.muse.index.IndexOptions, int);

Also I am not able to build with ant and it is failing with the following
error:

So I did the same thing as I always do, to compile only the seaview src
files and update the class files in the unifi.jar that I have.

Thank you.
Sorry, for late response.

Praharsha is a mathematical genius which even made us feel jealous some
times :)
He is a punctual, disciplined, calm-going, patient and a helping friend.
I can say he is always the first to step-forward to help any of his friend
in need.
Never had he caused any harm to anyone in life and or during/after death.
He left us all with a tragic loss in an incident we can never forget.

I got an intern in GE Research Bangalore, I came to know about this just today.
As the work being Research, they are expecting at least 2 months of work.
Starting from June 24th(Monday) to August 23rd.
I am aware that, one can extend the holidays by two weeks i.e. from August 6th
to August 20th, but still I am falling short of few days.
What do you suggest, I should do?
Please note that I have already tried from the company side to change the dates,
This is the best that I can do to close-pack it.
[I actually also cancelled my trip to manali, this summer supposed to
be from 20th to 24th June]

Thank you.

These are the list of tools that are used to make the compiler.
Python Interpreter.
PLY:  To parse the code with regular grammer and then with Context free =
grammer,python lexer and parser [basically mocking of YACC and bison in =
C].
LLVMPY: Python wrapper of LLVM. Used to generate and translate the code.
Pydot: To generate the dot programs for plotting of graph with graphviz.
Graphviz: To plot the AST from dot program.
We have used bunch of programs to test the code at each step.
Lexer:
We have written rules for lexer in PLY with reference to the tiger =
manual. Almost all the tokens for special symbols and special constructs =
relevant to tiger code are parsed and emitted in the form of tokens at =
this stage. Regular expressions were used to represent the regular =
grammer.
Parser:
In this stage the attributes are appended to the tokens along with =
various expressions being parsed. This forms the basis step for the =
Abstract syntax tree[AST]. As the code is parsed, AST is synthesised. As =
the parser is an LALR(1) parser which is bottom up parser, hence to the =
end of parsing the top level symbol is passed on to the AST. This makes =
the tree synthesis easy. Conflicts (Shift-reduce and reduce-reduce =
conflicts) were both warned at the time of generation of parse tables =
and actions were made to remove/prune such conflicts.=20
The parser rules were written with reference to the tiger manual.
AST-generation and plotting:
AST must have been generated with the success of parsing itself. Various =
attributes were appended to each node such as the type,  name of the =
token.
Parser returns the root node of the parsed program and this root node is =
traversed recursively to enumerate the nodes and edges. This is then fed =
to pydot which generates the dot program which is in-turn fed to =
graphviz to make a png of the graph.
Semantic analysis:
To parse and analyse some intrinsic errors in the program which would =
not have been possible with the previous phases are analysed at this =
stage. The various errors that were detected are:=20
Type mismatches between variable and assignments.
Variable usage without declaration.
Double declaration of variable usage.
Variable declared but never used.
Function redeclaration.
Function usage without declaration.
Mismatch between function argument and argument type.
Mismatch between number of function arguments and expected number.
Scope shadowing of a particular variable [as a warning].
All scope mismatches.
Any of the above will cause the program to terminate without further =
processing except for 9.
 This is employed as a recursive approach: where every node is =
recursively checked for semantic errors. Context object is maintained =
each and every time we enter a new scope and popped the scope off the =
stack of attribute the fact that the scope is no more available.=20

These are the list of tools that are used to make the compiler.
Python Interpreter.
PLY:  To parse the code with regular grammer and then with Context free =
grammer,python lexer and parser [basically mocking of YACC and bison in =
C].
LLVMPY: Python wrapper of LLVM. Used to generate and translate the code.
Pydot: To generate the dot programs for plotting of graph with graphviz.
Graphviz: To plot the AST from dot program.
We have used bunch of programs to test the code at each step.
Lexer:
We have written rules for lexer in PLY with reference to the tiger =
manual. Almost all the tokens for special symbols and special constructs =
relevant to tiger code are parsed and emitted in the form of tokens at =
this stage. Regular expressions were used to represent the regular =
grammer.
Parser:
In this stage the attributes are appended to the tokens along with =
various expressions being parsed. This forms the basis step for the =
Abstract syntax tree[AST]. As the code is parsed, AST is synthesised. As =
the parser is an LALR(1) parser which is bottom up parser, hence to the =
end of parsing the top level symbol is passed on to the AST. This makes =
the tree synthesis easy. Conflicts (Shift-reduce and reduce-reduce =
conflicts) were both warned at the time of generation of parse tables =
and actions were made to remove/prune such conflicts.=20
The parser rules were written with reference to the tiger manual.
AST-generation and plotting:
AST must have been generated with the success of parsing itself. Various =
attributes were appended to each node such as the type,  name of the =
token.
Parser returns the root node of the parsed program and this root node is =
traversed recursively to enumerate the nodes and edges. This is then fed =
to pydot which generates the dot program which is in-turn fed to =
graphviz to make a png of the graph.
Semantic analysis:
To parse and analyse some intrinsic errors in the program which would =
not have been possible with the previous phases are analysed at this =
stage. The various errors that were detected are:=20
Type mismatches between variable and assignments.
Variable usage without declaration.
Double declaration of variable usage.
Variable declared but never used.
Function redeclaration.
Function usage without declaration.
Mismatch between function argument and argument type.
Mismatch between number of function arguments and expected number.
Scope shadowing of a particular variable [as a warning].
All scope mismatches.
Any of the above will cause the program to terminate without further =
processing except for 9.
 This is employed as a recursive approach: where every node is =
recursively checked for semantic errors. Context object is maintained =
each and every time we enter a new scope and popped the scope off the =
stack of attribute the fact that the scope is no more available.=20

This method can be more efficient than extraction feature vectors: as

I am selected as the GSA of IIT Mandi and attended a summit in goa on
Google's Invitation.
As a GSA my job (in short) is to be a liaison between Google and our
institute and to plan and host few events in the campus.
I thank the institute and Google for giving me this opportunity and I try

Hi Vihari

You are selected and sorry for the confusion. Maybe you filled the
application form twice so one app got accepted and the other was rejected.
Welcome to the GSA community. You can join the email group. I am wondering
if you can make it to the GSA summit since getting to Goa is difficult from
Mandi.

Thanks
Ashwani

for the sake of seaview we can classify log file analysis broadly as:
1. Where source code is relevant and
2. and where it is not.
Relevant I mean helpful.
Its not relevant or helpful in the case of intrusion detection(like DOS
attack) or system monitoring(operation profiling) here the dimensional
grouping of variables is of very less use.
It is relevant in the cases of ensuring correctness or exception caused
because of the bug in the code or misconfigurations or
because of the bad input values which were not handled well with asserts
for that matter.

As M.Nagappan puts it: It make more sense in the case of TCP flow to adopt
a log abstraction which can talk about flow rather than individual
fragments.
Though this can be done even in log analysis phase, the scope limited.
As to make Seaview useful in the case 2[see above enumeration], needs a lot
of robustness in log abstraction or log analysis phase to adopt many
contexts of log files,
we shall conclude that Seaview has more relevance in case 1.

Tudumi and Mielog fall into case 2 and are useful in visualization of timed
events and outlier detection.
Mielog:
The severity of logs are based on the frequency of occurrence and
differentiated based on their lengths.
The length of the logs are what then serve to detect outliers.

muse.all_logins_complete = function(sent_folder_found) {
muse.log ('all login responses received');
var params = muse.collect_input_fields();

if (sent_folder_found && $('#sent-messages-only').attr('checked')){

...

}
else {
muse.log ('redirecting to folders');
window.location = 'folders?' + params;
}
};

In the case of mbox, resultpage is redirected to folders.jsp and that in
turn triggers muse.sendfolders upon clicking Go, I don't see where
prepareMemoryTest.jsp is called in the process(its probably a bug).

I changed the trigger function to muse.do_memory_test and got some obscure
error messages like unable to lock over some file and so on.

Finally I was luckily able to do this with imap server with no problems in
that case.


I also ran into some error while instrumentation:

OutOfBounds exception in get_local_var_unit function in MethodUnits.java

I made a temporary change so that I can move forward, which may result in
bad results later; better we fix this soon.
