This project is aimed at easing the analysis of log file. This project is the sister project of unifi (https://github.com/hangal/unifi).

Usage:
1) The java class files of the software need to be instrumented at first with unifi.
2) Once the software is instrumented, the software can now be run normally and then preserve the log file produced.
3) Host the downloaded package in a webserver and open it in a browser either firefox or chrome (Not any other, atleast for now!).
4) You can just open the log file that was produced by the instrumented software, from the browser.
5) The page can then navigate you to all the analysis you can make. (Well the documentation is yet to be written.)
